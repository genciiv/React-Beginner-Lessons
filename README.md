# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ReactJS Tutorial for Beginners

## 1.What is React ?

React is an open source javascript library for building user interfaces.
React is a project created and maintained by Facebook.
React has more than a 100 thousand stars on GitHub and a huge community behind it.
React has become increasingly 
popular among developers and is also one of the most sought out skill-sets by companies right now.

React has a component based architecture. This lets you break down your application into small encapsulated parts which can then be composed to make more complex UI.
React is declarative.
React will make it painless for you to create complex UIs by abstracting away the difficult parts. 
React will handle efficiently updating and rendering just the right components in your application when your data changes. 
DOM updates which is one of the more expensive operations is handled gracefully in React.
